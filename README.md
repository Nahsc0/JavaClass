# Java Class Repository

Welcome to the Java Class repository! This repository is designed to help you learn Java programming language with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Throughout this course, we will cover various concepts including creating loan applications, utilizing if statements, functions, loops, and much more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download and install JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

Once you have Java installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:



## Course Structure

The repository is organized into different modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of Java programming. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

1. **Module 1: Introduction to Java**
    - Basic syntax and structure of Java programs.
    - Understanding data types, variables, and operators.
  
2. **Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming**
    - Introduction to classes and objects.
    - Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  
3. **Module 3: Conditional Statements and Loops**
    - Using if statements for decision making.
    - Implementing loops such as for, while, and do-while.
  
4. **Module 4: Functions and Methods**
    - Writing functions to encapsulate reusable code.
    - Understanding method overloading and overriding.
  
5. **Module 5: Java Applications**
    - Building simple loan application programs.
    - Integrating various concepts learned throughout the course.

## How to Use

Each module contains code examples, exercises, and assignments to reinforce your understanding of Java programming concepts. You can navigate through the modules sequentially, starting from Module 1.

For each module, you'll find:
- Code examples (`examples/`) demonstrating key concepts.
- Exercises (`exercises/`) to practice what you've learned.
- Assignments (`assignments/`) to apply your knowledge to real-world problems.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and experiment with different scenarios. Learning Java is best done through hands-on practice!
